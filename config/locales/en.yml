      <strong>FlyWeight</strong> is a website that lets passengers discreetly
      inform pilots of their weight in a private manner. No account is necessary
      for passengers and no one but the pilot can see each passenger’s weight.

        Share a link to this page with your passengers so they can privately add
        their weights. They will not be able to see anyone else’s weight, only
        add their own.

        If so, you should add your weight down below so your pilot can do their
        proper pre-flight planning. It’s important not to takeoff overweight,
        which is why you’re being asked to reveal your weight.
      explanation2: >-
        Your weight will not be shared with anyone except the pilot. It will be
        available to the pilot only until one week after the flight.
