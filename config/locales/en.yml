# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    lede: >-
      <strong>FlyWeight</strong> is a website that lets passengers discreetly
      inform pilots of their weight in a private manner. No account is necessary
      for passengers and no one but the pilot can see each passenger’s weight.

        If so, you should add your weight down below so your pilot can do their
        proper pre-flight planning. It’s important not to takeoff overweight,
        which is why you’re being asked to reveal your weight.

        Your weight will not be shared with anyone except the pilot. It will be
        available to the pilot only until one week after the flight.
